# Data-Agumentation


## Definition of DATA AGUMENTATION

Data augmentation in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data. It acts as a regularizer and helps reduce overfitting when training a machine learning model.

## Objective of this Project


As when we perform deep learning project the first and for most important thing is data.So by using the data agumentation technique with certain parameters I build a custom data agumentation by using which you can create as many number of images you want.
